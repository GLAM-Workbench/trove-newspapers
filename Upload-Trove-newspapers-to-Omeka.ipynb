    "# Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka-S\n",
    "\n",
    "I was keen to play around with [Omeka-S](https://omeka.org/s/) – the new, Linked Open Data powered version of Omeka. In particular I wanted to understand its [API](https://omeka.org/s/docs/developer/key_concepts/api/), its use of [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), and how I could create and use relationships between different types of entities. I decided that one way of exploring these things was to build a pipeline that would make it easy to upload Trove newspaper articles to an Omeka site. I recently figured out how to generate nice thumbnails from newspaper articles, so I could add images as well. But what about the 'Linked' part of LOD? I thought I'd not only create records for the newspaper articles, I'd create records for each cited newspaper and link them to the articles. Things not strings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is not the only way to get Trove records into Omeka. You can save them to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and then use the [Zotero Import module](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/zoteroimport/) to upload to Omeka. My [first Omeka 'how to'](http://discontents.com.au/some-exhibition-magic-with-zotero-and-omeka/) (written 8 years ago!) talked about using the Zotero Import plugin to upload records from the National Archives of Australia. While the import module works well, I wanted the flexibility to generate new images on the fly, modify the metadata, and unflatten the Zotero records to build newspaper-to-article relationships. I also wanted to be able to get newspaper articles from other sources, such as Trove lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I started playing around I realised I could rejig my thumbnail generator to [get an image of the whole article](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/blob/master/Save-Trove-newspaper-article-as-image.ipynb). This is useful because Trove's article download options tend to slice up images in unpleasant ways. So I decided to upload the complete image (or images if the article is published across multiple pages) and let Omeka create the derivative versions. I also decided to upload the PDF version of the article generated by Trove as an alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, you can use this notebook to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get a Trove newspaper article using the Trove API\n",
    "* Generate an image for the article\n",
    "* Search the Omeka site using the API to see if the newspaper that published the article already has a record, if not create one.\n",
    "* Upload the article details to Omeka using the API, including a link to the newspaper record, as well as the article image(s) and PDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what newspaper articles are we uploading? I've created four different ways of selecting articles for upload. There are further details and configuration options for each of these  methods below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Option 1: Upload a Trove newspaper search](#Option-1%3A-Upload-a-Trove-newspaper-search)\n",
    "* [Option 2: Upload newspaper articles from a Trove list](#Option-2%3A-Upload-newspaper-articles-from-a-Trove-list)\n",
    "* [Option 3: Upload Trove newspaper articles saved in Zotero](#Option-3%3A-Upload-Trove-newspaper-articles-saved-in-Zotero)\n",
    "* [Option 4: Upload a list of article ids](#Option-4%3A-Upload-a-list-of-article-ids)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a fair bit of configuration involved in getting this all working, so make sure you follow the instructions under [Basic configuration](#Basic-configuration) and [Preparing Omeka-S](#Preparing-Omeka-S) before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a [newspaper article](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/162833980) in Trove:\n",

    "Here's the same article after it's been imported into Omeka. Note that the article is linked to the newspaper that published it using the `isPartOf` property. You can also see the images and PDF of the article that were automatically uploaded along with the metadata.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Basic configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all you need an Omeka-S site to upload to! If you don't have a site, a handy server, or a preferred web host, I'd suggest you set up an account with [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/) – they're affordable, have excellent support, and provide a one-click installer for Omeka-S. You'll be up and running very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your Omeka-S site, you need to add some configuration values in the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `API_URL` – the url (or endpoint) of your Omeka site's API. This is basically just the url of your site with `/api` on the end.\n",
    "* `KEY_IDENTITY` and `KEY_CREDENTIAL` these are the authentication keys you need to upload new records to Omeka-S.\n",
    "* `TROVE_API_KEY` – authentication key to access the Trove API\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for instructions on generating your keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating your Omeka keys\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To generate your keys, log in to the admin interface of your Omeka-S site and click on 'Users' in the side menu. \n",
    "2. Find your user account in the list and then click on the pencil icon to edit your details. \n",
    "3. Click on the 'API keys' tab.\n",
    "4. In the 'New key label' box, enter a name for your key – something like 'Trove upload' would be fine.\n",
    "5. Click on the 'Save' button.\n",
    "6. A message will appear with your `key_identity` and `key_credential` values – the `key_credential` is only ever displayed once, so copy them both now!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trove API key\n",
    "\n",

    "## Preparing Omeka-S\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start uploading newspaper articles we need to set up the vocabularies and templates we need in Omeka to describe them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the schema.org vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Omeka uses defined vocabularies to describe items. A number of vocabularies are built-in, but we're going to add the widely-used [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabularly. Amongst many other things, Schema.org includes classes for both `Newspaper` and `NewsArticle`. You can download the [Schema.org definition files here](https://schema.org/docs/developers.html). In the instructions below, I suggest installing the 'all layers' version of the definition file, as this includes the [Bib extension](https://bib.schema.org/) as well as [Pending changes](https://pending.schema.org/) such as `ArchiveComponent` and `ArchiveOrganization`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Schema.org in Omeka:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to the admin interface of your Omeka-S site and click on 'Vocabularies' in the side menu.\n",
    "2. Click on the 'Import new vocabulary button.\n",
    "3. In the `Vocabularly url` field enter http://schema.org/version/latest/all-layers.rdf\n",
    "4. In the `File format` field select 'RDF/XML'\n",
    "5. In the `Prefix` field enter 'schema'\n",
    "6. In the `Namespace URI` field enter http://schema.org/\n",
    "7. In the `Label` field enter 'Schema.org'\n",
    "8. Click 'Import' to complete the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the import form should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/omeka-vocab-import.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "See the Omeka-S documentation for [more information on managing vocabularies](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/content/vocabularies/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the Numeric Data Type module\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Numeric Data Type module](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/numericdatatypes/) gives you more options in defining the data type of a field. In particular, you can identify certain values as ISO formatted dates so they can then be properly formatted, sorted, and searched. The template I've created for newspaper articles (see below) uses the 'timestamp' data type to import the dates of the newspaper articles, so you'll need to install this module before importing the templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the [Numeric Data Type module](https://omeka.org/s/modules/NumericDataTypes/) to your computer.\n",
    "2. Upload the zipped module to the modules folder of your Omeka site.\n",
    "3. Unzip the module.\n",
    "4. Log in to the admin interface of your Omeka-S site and click on 'Modules' in the side menu.\n",
    "5. Click on the 'Install' button.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the Omeka-S documentation for [more information on installing modules](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing the resource templates \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the powerful features of Omeka is the ability to define the types of items you're working with using 'resource templates'. These resource templates associate the items with specific vocabulary classes and list the expected properties. I've created resource templates for 'Newspaper' and 'Newspaper article' and exported them as JSON. The Trove upload code looks for these templates, so they need to be imported into your Omeka site.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download [Newspaper.json](templates/Newspaper.json) and [Newspaper_article.json](templates/Newspaper_article.json) to your own computer.\n",
    "2. Log in to the admin interface of your Omeka-S site and click on 'Resource templates' in the side menu.\n",
    "3. Click on the 'Import' button\n",
    "4. Click on 'Browse' and select the `Newspaper.json` file you downloaded.\n",
    "5. Click on the 'Review import' button.\n",
    "6. Click on the 'Complete import' button.\n",
    "7. Click the 'Edit Resource Template' button.\n",
    "8. Find the `name` property and click on the pencil icon to edit it.\n",
    "9. Check the box next to 'Use for resource title', then click on the 'Set changes' button.\n",
    "10. Find the `description` property and click on the pencil icon to edit it.\n",
    "11. Check the box next to 'Use for resource description', then click on the 'Set changes' button.\n",
    "12. Click on the 'Save' button.\n",
    "13. Repeat the same procedure to import `Newspaper_article.json`, but check at the 'Review import' stage to make sure that the selected data type for the `datePublished` property is `Timestamp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I've deliberately kept the templates fairly simple. You might want to add additional properties. However, if you change or remove any of the existing properties, you'll probably also have to edit the `add_article()` function below.\n",
